 * FASE 3.4: Integration Tests (DEPRECATED)

 * Replaced by FASE 5 integration tests
 * See: src/__tests__/fase5_integration.test.ts
 *
 * This test file was part of Phase 3 but has been superseded by more comprehensive
 * integration tests in FASE 5 that properly test:
 * ✅ Create show → Dashboard updates optimistically
 * ✅ Update show → All components reflect change
 * ✅ Delete show → Removed from all views
 * ✅ Multi-tab sync → Changes visible in other tabs
 * ✅ Error scenarios → Automatic rollback
 * ✅ Performance → No UI blocking with large datasets
